                <strong>Hey! Girl,</strong> <br />In the tapestry of our shared moments, I've discovered a sentiment that refuses to be contained within the confines of silence. Your laughter resonates in the quiet corridors of my thoughts, and your presence paints my world with hues of warmth. It's with a heart brimming with honesty that I confess my feelings have taken root, blossoming into an undeniable affection. The prospect of us moving beyond the boundaries of friendship has become a compelling thought, and I find myself longing for the possibility of exploring this uncharted terrain together. Your response is a treasure I await, with hope and a touch of vulnerability. But Honestly, for me however you
                are, whoever you are, I will Love you the same, the same for all
                the quirks that made you the way you are. The Things how
                beautifully you look at the things and the way you innocently
                treat everyone. And whenever you think like this, I want you to
                see yourself from my eyes then you will realize how special you
                are !. I wanna make you so happy that you cant stop smiling and
                stop doubting yourself. I am just proud of you. <em>"Tum toh mera
                woh Chand ho, jo meri haar raat ko roshan karta hai."</em> I am proud
                of the you, how beautifully you have endured and achieved
                everything. Ik there might some of the things that might hurting
                you from inside, there might be some regrets, there might be
                some things you thinking guilty of, and Ik I can't fix
                everything But all I can promise you to be there whenever you
                need me. I just want to be there for you, to hold you when you
                feel to cry. I want to be the shoulder for you to cry on. You
                are my that favourite person whom I wish to see you everyday.
                Ahhh...üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èIk we don't meet each day, and even if you have many
                people in your life, I would like to say that I am here for you
